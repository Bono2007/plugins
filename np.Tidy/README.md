# ðŸ§¹ Tidy Up plugin

This plugin provides commands to help tidy up your notes:

- **/Remove orphaned blockIDs** (alias "rob"): Remove blockIDs from lines that had been sync'd, but have become 'orphans' as the other copies of the blockID have since been deleted.
- **/Remove section from recent notes** (alias "rsfrn"): Remove a given section (heading + its content block) from recently-changed notes. Can be used with parameters from Template or x-callback.
 - **/Remove content under heading in all notes** (alias "rcuh"). Use wisely, as this is dangerous! (original function by @dwertheimer)
- **/Remove time parts from @done() dates** (alias "rtp"): Remove time parts of @done(date time) from recently-updated notes. Can be used with parameters from Template or Callback.
- **/Remove @done() markers** (alias "rdm"): Remove @done(...) markers from recently-updated notes, optionally just from completed checklist items.
- **/File root-level notes** (alias "frnl"): For each root-level note, asks which folder you'd like it moved to. (There's a setting for ones to ignore.)

Most can be used with parameters from a Template, or via an x-callback call.

There's also the **/Tidy Up** (alias "tua"), which runs as many of the other commands in this plugin as you have configured.

## Using from Templates

You can use most of these capabilites from Template calls as well. They all take the form:

`<% await DataStore.invokePluginCommandByName("<command name>","np.Tidy",['<parameters>'])  %>`

Note: the parameters are passed as `"key":"value"` pairs separated by commas, and surrounded by curly brackets `{...}`. (This is JSON encoding.) Note the parameters then need to be surrounded by square brackets and single quotes.

For example:

`<% await DataStore.invokePluginCommandByName("Remove section from notes","np.Tidy",['{"numDays":2, "sectionHeading":"Test Delete Me"}'])  %>`

**Tip:** as these are complicated and fiddly to create, **I suggest you use @dwertheimer's excellent [Link Creator plugin]() command "/Get X-Callback-URL"** which makes it much simpler.

<!-- but if not ??? list params -->

**Note:** These work particularly well in **Daily Note templates** where they can be set to silently tidy things up over the last week or so.

## Using from x-callback calls

It's possible to call most of these commands from [outside NotePlan using the **x-callback mechanism**](https://help.noteplan.co/article/49-x-callback-url-scheme#runplugin). The URL calls all take the same form:

`noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Tidy&command=<encoded command name>&arg0=<encoded parameters>`

Notes:
- all parameters are passed as `"key":"value"` pairs separated by commas, and surrounded by curly brackets `{...}`. (This is JSON encoding.)
- as with all x-callback URLs, all the arguments (including the command name) need to be URL-encoded. For example, spaces need to be turned into '%20'.

This is an example of a fully URL-encoded call:

| un-encoded call | URL-encoded call |
| ----- | ----- |
| `noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Tidy&command=Remove section from notes&arg0={"numDays":20, "sectionHeading":"Test Delete Me"}` | `noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Tidy&command=Remove%20section%20from%20notes&arg0=%7B%22numDays%22%3A%202%2C%20%22sectionHeading%22%3A%22Test%20Delete%20Me%22%7D` |

The available parameters are:

| command name | parameter name |
| --------- | --------- |
| Remove @done() markers | foldersToExclude, justRemoveFromChecklists, numDays, runSilently |
| Remove orphaned blockIDs | runSilently |
| Remove section from all notes | keepHeading, runSilently, sectionHeading |
| Remove section from recent notes | matchType, sectionHeading |
| Remove time parts from @done() dates | runSilently |
<!-- | File root-level notes | rootNotesToIgnore | -->





**Tip:** as these are complicated and fiddly to create, **I strongly suggest you use @dwertheimer's excellent [Link Creator plugin]() command "/Get X-Callback-URL"** which makes it vastly easier.
