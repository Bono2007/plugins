# What's Changed in Previews plugin?
## [0.1.0] - 2022-09-???
- Initial release supporting Mermaid charts. The markdown-ish definition of these charts is done in one or more fenced code blocks:

```
``` mermaid
... chart defintion
lines  ...
```  .
```
(please ignore the closing period; it's just there to make this render in markdown)
