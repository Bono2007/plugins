# np.Preview WORK IN PROGRESS

This is some code from @jgclark  to help @EduardMe develop the **Preview** or **Render** feature.  

**Mermaid** charts are supported from code blocks:

```
``` mermaid
... chart defintion
lines  ...
```  .
```
(please ignore the closing period; it's just there to make this render in markdown)

**MathML** is basically working, and needs the same code block idea as for Mermaid above.
