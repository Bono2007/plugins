# np.Templating Changelog

### About np.Templating Plugin
See Plugin [README](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/blob/main/np.Templating/README.md) for details on available commands and use case.

## [1.0.0-beta.09] - 2022-03-15 (mikeerickson)

- replaced all `fetch` calls to use `fetchWithTimeout` which will handle condition where API service goes offline, returning "An error occurred accessing {serviceName} service" message if request takes longer than timeout
- fixed "Quick Notes" migration, removing `Test` defintion
- added `np:migrate-templates` command which can be used to inititate migration from "ðŸ“‹ Templates" to "@Templates"
- added `migraQuickNotes` to end of `migrateTemplates` so the process will happen at the same time (previously you had to execute `np:migrate-quick-notes` manually)
- restored conversion of `{{ date8601() }}` to `<%- date8601() %>`
- added `format` and `now` helpers from DateModule (see `datemodule-module.test.js` for example)
- added `getAttributes` and `getBody` from FrontMatterModule (see `frontmatter-module.test.js` for example)

## [1.0.0-beta.08] - 2022-03-14 (mikeerickson)

- Removed spurious `dog` override in "Quick Notes"
- Fixed issue when migrating Quick Notes (inadvertent `Test` folder creation)
- Fixed issue with promise based methods in templates not excecuting (all method calls are converted to async/await at runtime)
  - You should not be required to have `await` keyword in templates
  - For example:  `<%- date8601() %>` is converted to `<%- await date86010() %>` at runtime

## [1.0.0-beta.07] - 2022-03-14 (mikeerickson)

- Removed `usePrompts` parameter from options as this will be on by default, thus no longer required
- Removed some spurious `console.log` statements (don't litter the console)
- Added alert if "Quick Notes" folder does not exists when executing `np:qtn` command
  - See np.Templating Settings to override default "Quick Notes" folder name

## [1.0.0-beta.06] - 2022-03-14 (mikeerickson)

- removed `docs` directory, moved to [np.Templating Docs](https://nptemplating-docs.netlify.app/)
- fixed issue when selecting `Cancel` in prompt message, throwing incorrect error

## [1.0.0-beta.05] - 2022-03-14 (mikeerickson)

- fix `__tests__/fronmatter-module.test.js` using new fixtures
- added `np:qtn` to replace current `/qtn` and will be adding `/qtn` when `nmn.Templates` is deprecated
- fixed several issues with prompt interface, including display multiple prompts for same key

## [1.0.0-beta.04] - 2022-02-26 (mikeerickson)

- added support for new template format introduced by `NotePlan 3.4.1` and frontmatter formatted templates
- fixed issue where templates were sometimes being loaded from old "Templates" directory, it should now ONLY use `@Templates`
- renamed **globals** helper `date` to `currentDate` as `date` is a reserved work for internal Date Module
- fixed issues with **globals** date methods, including

```html
**pickdate:**
- <%- pickDate() %>
- <%- pickDate({question:'Please enter a date:'}) %>
- <%- pickDateInterval() %>
- <%- pickDateInterval({question:'Date interval to use:'}) %>
```

## [1.0.0-beta.03] - 2022-02-24 (mikeerickson)
