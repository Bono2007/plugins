# Simple Test

That title was created dynamically ^^^^
and so was this:
## Week of: <%- weekDates() %>
And the note was put in the folder of choice
All with one popup choice
...and if you only had one item in your list, it wouldn't even ask you!

Don't forget the weather in LA (that's a template tag--just testing)!
<%- weather() %>
