## Things which look like RAW text:

## h2
### h3
* A star todo
- a bullet item 
1. Ordered list
`inline code`
> quote text

## Things which don't look like RAW text:

a dash and brackets todo (`- [ ]`) NP hides the brackets, so it looks like a bullet/list item
* [x] task which is done doesn't show the [x]. @done(2021-09-07 08:34 PM)
 scheduled task doesn't show the [>] >2021-09-08
* [-] cancelled task. doesn't show the [-]

These are re-drawn:
