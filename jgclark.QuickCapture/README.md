# NoteHelpers plugin
This plugin provides commands to quickly add tasks/todos or general text to NotePlan notes:

- `/int`: Quickly add a task to your 'ðŸ“¥ Inbox' note (defaults to Daily note, but can be configured to a different specific one)
- `/qath`: Quickly add a task at the top of a chosen note's heading
- `/qalh`: Quickly add text lines at the top of a chosen note's heading
- `/qad`: Quickly append a task to a chosen daily (calendar) note
- `/qat`: Quickly append a task to a chosen project note
- `/qpd`: Quickly prepend a task to a chosen daily (calendar) note
- `/qpt`: Quickly prepend a task to a chosen project note

## Configuration
`/int` now uses the `Daily Note Template` note found in the `Templates` folder. If this note has not been added, it should prompt you to create one.

In the `Templates/_configuration` note, include the following settings you want in the note's first configuration block. For example:

`
```javascript
	...
	inbox: {
		inboxFilename: "ðŸ“¥ Inbox.md", // leave blank to use today's daily note, or give relative filename (e.g. "Folder/Inbox.md", ignoring the starting '/')
		inboxTitle: "ðŸ“¥ Inbox", // or whatever you want to call it
		addInboxPosition: "prepend",  // or "append"
	},
	...
```
`
(This example fragment is in JSON5 format, but you can also use TOML or YAML formats: see the help text in `_configuration` note. Ensure there are commas at the end of all that lines that need them.)
