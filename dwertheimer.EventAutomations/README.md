# Event Automations

## "Create Note From Calendar Item" command
- asks you for a template and for a folder where you want to save the item

## "Create Note From Calendar Item w/QuickTemplate" command
- uses a preset template you established in the 
`_configuration` file / `quickNotes` field, where you pre-establish a pre-existing template to use, a folder to save new notes in, a title format, etc.
- will be set up on first use

## Limitations
Right now, the title is fixed. Some day I will add configuration fields to allow you to be more creative with your title
