# insertPluginFunctionNameHere plugin

[You will delete this text and replace it with a readme about your plugin -- not ever seen by users, but good for people looking at your code. Before you delete though, you should know:]

You do not need all of this scaffolding for a basic NP plugin. As the instructions state (https://help.noteplan.co/article/65-commandbar-plugins), you can create a plugin with just two files: `plugin.json` and `script.js`. 

However, for more complex plugins, you may find that it's easier to write code in multiple files, incorporating code (helper functions, etc.) written (and *TESTED*) previously by others. You also may want type checking (e.g. Flow.io) to help validate the code you write. If either of those is interesting to you, you're in the right place. Before going any further, make sure you follow the dev environment setup instructions (https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins). 

Then create a copy of this skeleton, do a global find/replace for `insertPluginFunctionNameHere` for the function name of your plugin's JS entry point (it will be listed in the plugin.json). And change the filename `insertPluginFunctionNameHere.js` to match. Give the skeleton folder a name (e.g. your githubUsername.pluginOrCollectionOfCommandsName)

That's it. Happy coding! 

Hat-tip to @eduard, @nmn & @jgclark, who made all this fancy cool stuff.
