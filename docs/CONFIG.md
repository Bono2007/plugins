# NotePlan Plugin Configuration

## Overview
NotePlan Plugins use a configuration file `plugin.json` which resides in the root level of your plugin folder (e.g., `codedungeon.Toolbox/plugin.json`) and is used by the NotePlan Plugin Preferences to dsiplay information about your plugin, and the plugin entrypoints and commands.

### Plugin Command Object
The `plugin.json` file contains a key labeled `plugin.commands` which is an array of command objects

```json
...
"plugin.commands": [{
	"name": "helloWorld",
	"description": "Say hello!",
	"jsFunction": "helloWorldFunctionName"
}]
...
```

## Plugin Versioning
The `plugin.json` file contains a key labeled `plugin.version` which NotePlan uses to determine the current version of a given plugin, and is used to determine if an updated version is available.

‚ùóÔ∏è You must follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) when formatting your version numbers.

There are three required parts to a version number

**major** - The `major` version will increment whenever major features are added to your plugin, or if there are breaking changes
**minor** - The `minor` number will increment whenever minor functionality is added to your plugin, such as a new command, or enhancing an existing command.
**patch** - The `patch` number will be incremented whenever you are fixing an issue to an existing command

In addition, if you are release a beta or pull request (pr) version, followed by incremental changes which occur during the testing period.

**type** - The `type` of version, either `pr` or `beta`

#### Pull Request Release (required)
If you are creating a new plugin and submitting it as a PR, use the `pr` part, and increment each time a new build is updated.
This will be important during the review process as it will be displayed in the **NotePlan Preferences - Plugin** dialog

`0.0.1-pr.1` would be the first `pr` release
`0.0.1-pr.2` would be the second `pr` release

#### Beta Release (not required)
If you are working on providing a feature/fix to an existing plugin, use the `beta` part, and increment each time a new build is updated
Once your plugin has been published for public consumption, if you are in a `testing` phase for external users, you should use the `beta` version until the plugin is deemed "final"

`0.0.1-beta.1` would be the first `beta` release
`0.0.1-beta.2` would be the second `beta` release
