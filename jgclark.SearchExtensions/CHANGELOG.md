# What's Changed in ðŸ”Ž Search Extensions plugin?
(And see the full [README](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.SearchExtensions).)
<!-- 
- searches now run over Weekly Notes as well (now the underlying API has been extended)
- ??? sort ordering?
-->
## [0.4.0] - 2022-07-09
### Added
- new command **/quickSearch** which searches over all notes and shows the results in a fixed results note, whose title is given by new setting '/quickSearch note title' (default: Quick Search Results)

## [0.3.0] - 2022-07-08
### Added
- new setting 'Automatically save' when turned on automatically decides the name of the note to save the search results to (based on the search term), which avoids the final prompt. (for @dwertheimer)

## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-05
### Added
- the order of results can now be set: by title, created date, or changed date of the note the result is found in. This can be changed in the Settings.

## [0.1.2] - 2022-07-05
### Fixed
- fixed problem with /saveSearchOverNotes command

## [0.1.1] - 2022-07-03
Mostly to help track down apparent inconsistency in the API.
### Added
- added /saveSearchOverNotes command
- added /saveSearchOverCalendar command

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-02
First release, with commands from earlier Summaries plugin.
### Changes
- speeded up the **/saveSearchResults** **/saveSearchResultsInPeriod** commands significantly. (Under the hood the plugin now uses an API that takes advantage of caching.)
- now trims the display of matching results in search output, but still highlights the matched terms
