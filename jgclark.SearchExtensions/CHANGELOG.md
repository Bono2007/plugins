# What's Changed in ðŸ”Ž Search Extensions plugin?
(And see the full [README](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/tree/main/jgclark.SearchExtensions).)
<!-- 
- searches now run over Weekly Notes as well (now the underlying API has been extended)
-->

## [0.5.0] - 2022-07-22
### Added
- Major new version, that now supports + and - search operators for terms that _must_ appear, and _must not_ appear, respectively.  For example `+"must have me" may could -"cannot have me"` has 4 search terms, the first must be present, the last mustn't be present, and the middle two (may, could) can be.
- the test for + and - is done per line in notes. If you wish to ignore the whole note that has a term, you can use the ! operator, e.g. `+must !not-me`.
- you can now refresh results in a single click, with the 'button link' under the heading on each search page
- an API call for this that also allows restricting search to one or more paragraph types (e.g. 'open' for incomplete tasks), through the last parameter on `runSearchV2(...)`.
- provides x-callback entry points for these searches -- see README for details.

**Notes for beta2**:
- fixed ordering of result lines within a note
- added support for search strings using older `x AND y AND z` or `x OR y OR z` or `x, y, z` styles. (Note: you can't mix AND and OR style, as it's hard to then be clear what the right logic is. The newer syntax is clearer.)
- added support for `"multi word search terms"` -- though I now discover that NotePlan might not support this :-(

**Notes for beta1**:
- I've only really tested the /quickSearch command so far

**Still TODO:**:
- resolve API question about multi-word search phrases
- added a "Style for search results" setting. This chooses the style to use:
  - Normal "NotePlan" styling, tweaked slightly for matching headings
  - Use "Simplified" text (like Google results)
- add highlighting in
- finish test for applySearchOperators
- support `"multi-word terms"`
- decide whether to support case insensitivity option still
- decide whether to support showEmptyResults option still, or just turn on?
- support un-grouped results (?)
- hook up x-callback for calendar-only searching
- properly test x-callbacks
- update README
- shift some functions and tests to helpers/search.

## [0.4.1] - 2022-07-11
### Added
- new command **/quickSearch** which searches over all notes and shows the results in a fixed results note, whose title is given by new setting '/quickSearch note title' (default: Quick Search Results)
### Changed
- much speedier searches, now it can take advantage of NotePlan improvements in build 813+
### Fixed
- The opening in split window now works reliably (thanks to @dwertheimer)

## [0.3.0] - 2022-07-08
### Added
- new setting 'Automatically save' when turned on automatically decides the name of the note to save the search results to (based on the search term), which avoids the final prompt. (for @dwertheimer)

## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-05
### Added
- the **order** of results can now be set: by title, created date, or changed date of the note the result is found in. This can be changed in the Settings.

## [0.1.1..0.1.2] - 2022-07-05
### Added
- added /saveSearchOverNotes command
- added /saveSearchOverCalendar command
### Fixed
- fixed problem with /saveSearchOverNotes command

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-02
First release, with commands from earlier Summaries plugin.
### Changes
- speeded up the **/saveSearchResults** **/saveSearchResultsInPeriod** commands significantly. (Under the hood the plugin now uses an API that takes advantage of caching.)
- now trims the display of matching results in search output, but still highlights the matched terms
