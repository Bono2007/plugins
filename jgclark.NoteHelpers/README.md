# ðŸ“™ NoteHelpers plugin
This plugin provides these commands to help jump quickly between NotePlan notes, and manage them (with short names available as command aliases):
- `/open note new window` (alias `/onw`): open a user-selected note in a new window
- `/open note new split` (alias `/ons`): open a user-selected note in a new split of the main window
- `/jump to note's heading` (alias `/jh`): jumps the cursor to the selected heading in the current note
- `/jump to note` (alias `/jn`): jump to a different note, and then selected heading
- `/jump to done` (alias `/jd`): simply jumps the cursor to the `## Done` section of the current note (if it exists)
- `/move note` (alias `/mn`): which moves a note to a different folder the user selects
- `/make notes index` (alias `/index`): Make/Update note link Indexes for one or more folders

It now has added the `/make notes index` (alias `/index`) command to make/update note link Indexes for one or more folders.
