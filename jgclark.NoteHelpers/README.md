# NoteHelpers plugin
This plugin provides commands to help work with NotePlan notes:
- `/mn`: which moves a note to a different folder the user selects
- `/jh`: jumps the cursor to the heading of the current note that the user selects
- `/jd`: simply jumps the cursor to the `## Done` section of the current note (if it exists)
- `/nns`: create a new note from selection (and leave link to it in its place)

## Configuration
Before the configuration mechanism is available, you need to update the `jgclark.noteHelpers\noteHelpers.js` file in the plugin's folder directly. Update the following lines at the top of the file accordingly:
```js
// Items that should come from the Preference framework in time:
pref_templateName.push("Daily note structure")
pref_templateText.push("### Tasks\n### Media\n\n### Journal\n")
pref_templateName.push("Project Meeting note")
pref_templateText.push("### Project X Meeting on [[date]] with @Y and @Z\n\n### Notes\n\n### Actions\n")
```
You can have any number of templates defined, but each needs a Name and Text.  If there is only a single template configured, then it will be applied automatically by `applyTemplate`.

Templates should normally end with a linefeed character (`\n`).
