<!-- split out CSS to a separate file -->
## [0.3.3] - 2023-03-???
### Changed
<!-- - trying again with simpler focus window where we can ??? -->

## [0.3.2] - 2023-03-25
### Changed
- a new way of testing when to refresh the dashboard based on changes in daily/weekly notes. This avoids most false positives.
### Added
- command to edit settings, even on iOS
- new Debug setting for Triggering dashboard refreshes

## [0.3.1] - 2023-03-15
### Added
- when completing a task/checklist in the dashboard, it will now have a @done(...) date added if the user has 'add completion date' setting ticked.
### Fixed
- clicking note links with apostrophes in them

## [0.3.0] 2023-03-11
### Added
- when clicking on a paragraph, it will now highlight the right paragraph in the editor, not just open the note
- will now automatically update the dashboard window when a change is made in the relevant calendar note. (This requires adding `triggers: onEditorWillSave => jgclark.Dashboard.decideWhetherToUpdateDasboard` to the frontmatter of the relevant daily/weekly note.)
- supports multi-column display, when the window is wide enough
- de-dupes items that would appear twice in a list because the lines are sync'd together
- Now updates the totals and counts

## [0.2.0] 2023-02-28  (unreleased)
### Added
- Tasks and Checklist items can now be marked as completed; the underlying NotePlan note is updated, and the item is removed from the list in the window. (Big thanks to @dwertheimer for the clever bi-directional infrastructure that makes this possible.)
- Note: This relies on the new "Shared Resources" plugin to be installed and active.

## [0.1.0] (unreleased)
- first version, providing read-only view of all tasks and checklists due today or this week. Plus list of the next 3 projects to review (if you use the Projects + Reviews plugin.)
