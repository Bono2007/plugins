# ðŸŽ› Dashboard plugin
This plugin provides a 'dashboard' window that in one place shows a compact list of just the:
- open tasks and checklists from today's note
- scheduled open tasks and checklists from other notes to today
- open tasks and checklists from this week's note
- scheduled open tasks and checklists from other notes to this week
- next few notes to review (if you use the "Projects and Reviews" plugin)

<!-- ??? picture needed -->

Note: _It provides this in a read-only view that doesn't use NotePlan's normal editor, but a more flexible HTML-based display that mimics your current NotePlan theme._

Note: In this first release, you cannot "check off" or "complete" tasks or checklist items: the usual symbols are just to be consistent with how it looks in the NotePlan editor.
